 <h3><b>What is CO & PO ?</b> </h3>
 <br></br>
 <b>Course outcomes</b> typically include both technical and non-technical aspects. They are designed to provide a clear understanding of what students should be able to do or demonstrate upon completion of the course. These outcomes are often expressed as measurable statements that can be assessed or evaluated.
 <b>Program Outcomes</b> are specific statements that describe the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that students are expected to possess by the time they complete a particular educational program or course of study.

Program Outcomes are broader than Course Outcomes (COs) and are applicable to the entire program rather than individual courses. They reflect the overall goals and objectives of the program and provide a comprehensive view of what students should achieve in terms of learning outcomes.
 <br></br><br></br>
Course Outcome is evaluated based on the performance of students in internal assessments and in End examination of a course. 
Internal assessment and End examinations assessment contributes to the total attainment of a CO.

After measuring CO attainment for a course, CO-PO mapping table will give Program Outcome attainment levels.
 The 6 course outcomes are written by the respective faculty member using action verbs of learning levels.
 The Program outcomes (PO’s) are defined by NBA, New Delhi which are mandatory. Program outcomes describe what 
 students are expected to know and would be able to do by the time of graduation. These relate to the skills, 
knowledge, and behaviors that students acquire as they progress through the program.

<h3><b>Course Outcome Assessment Process</b> </h3>  
     <br></br>

The Key aspects in Outcome-Based Education (OBE) are the assessment of Course
 Outcomes. At the initial stage of OBE implementation, the Course Outcomes (COs)
  for each course are defined based on the Program Outcomes (POs) and other requirements.
   At the end of each course, the COs need to be assessed and evaluated to check whether they 
   have been attained or not.
        
The process of attainment of COs, POs starts from writing appropriate
 COs for each course of the program. Then, a correlation is established between COs and POs in the scale of 1 to 3, 
 1 being the slight (low), 2 being moderate (medium) and 3 being substantial (high). 
 A mapping matrix is prepared in this regard for every course in the program including the elective subjects. The course outcomes written and their mapping with POs
 are reviewed frequently by a committee of senior faculty members before they are finalized.
